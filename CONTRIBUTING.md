# Contributing Guide

## How to contribute

If you encounter a bug, think of a useful feature, or find something confusing in the docs, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-theme-inspector/issues/new)!

If you're thinking of adding a big new feature, consider opening an issue first to discuss it to ensure it aligns to the direction of the project (and potentially save yourself some time!).
